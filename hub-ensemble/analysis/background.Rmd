Epidemiological forecasts make quantitative statements about a disease outcome in the near future. At the most general level forecasting targets can include measures of disease incidence, prevalence, or severity, for example forecasting reported cases, hospitalisations, or deaths for some geographical location over a specified time horizon. Multiple forecasts of Covid-19 outcomes have been critical to responding to the global outbreaks of Covid-19 since early 2020, for both policy makers and the general public [1]. However, often studies present forecasts from a single model [2], with methods varying widely from structured mathematical to purely statistical models [3]. While these forecasts are individually useful, there are barriers to accessing and comparing between forecasts for the same target. These include variation in outcome definition, aggregation of time or space, or reporting of probability [2].

A “forecast hub” is a centralised effort to improve the transparency and utility of forecasts, by standardising and collating the work of many independent teams producing forecasts in the public domain [4]. A hub sets a commonly agreed structure for forecast targets, such as type of disease event, spatio-temporal units, or the set of quantiles of the probability distribution to include from probabilistic forecasts. Forecasters then adopt this structure to format existing model outputs, and at regular intervals contribute forecasts for centralised storage. This allows forecasts produced from diverse teams and methods to be visualised and quantitatively compared on a near-exact like to like basis, which can strengthen public and policy use of disease forecasts.

The underlying approach to creating a forecast hub was pioneered for forecasting influenza in the USA and quickly adapted for forecasts of short-term Covid-19 cases and deaths in US states and counties [5]. This has also been adopted to forecasts for subnational units in Germany and Poland [6]. Similar efforts exist at a national scale in Austria [7] and the UK [8] and for longer term scenario projections in the USA [9], while forecasts for Covid-19 mortality at a national level worldwide have also been passively collected and evaluated [10]. Somewhat comparably, weather forecasting has a long standing use of building ensembles of many models using diverse methods with standardised data and formatting [11,12].

The European Covid-19 Forecast Hub [13] is a project to collate short term forecasts of Covid-19 across 32 countries in the European region. The Hub is jointly run with the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC), with the primary aim to provide reliable information about the short-term epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic to the research and policy communities and the general public. Second, the hub aims to create infrastructure for storing and analysing epidemiological forecasts made in real time by diverse research teams and methods across Europe. Third, the hub aims to maintain a community of infectious disease modellers underpinned by open science principles. We started formally collating and combining contributions to the European Forecast Hub in March 2021. Here, we investigate the predictive performance of forecasts contributed to the hub and their combination into weighted and unweighted ensembles.
