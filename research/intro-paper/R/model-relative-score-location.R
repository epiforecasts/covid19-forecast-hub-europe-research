# Caption:
# Average model score against baseline score, on a log scale for
# 1 week forecasts of each target location. Higher scores indicate higher error
# and worse performance. High scores in both dimensions suggest a location with
# difficult to predict dynamics. The diagonal dotted line indicates equivalence to the
# baseline. The forecast models were exceptionally good at predicting locations
# below the diagonal line. Dotted lines indicate the average score across all locations
# for the baseline (vertical) and all other models (horizontal).
